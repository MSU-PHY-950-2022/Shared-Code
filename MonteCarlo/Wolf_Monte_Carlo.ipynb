    "\n",
    "This code is intended to produce a simulation of wolf and prey populations over a specified time series.  The classroom discussion led to the following PRELIMINARY details about the simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is [an interesting reference](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239927489_Kill_Rates_and_Predation_by_Wolves_on_Ungulate_Populations_in_Bialowieza_Primeval_Forest_Poland?enrichId=rgreq-644c6d606fbbf71d082d4cbb0ade1da6-XXX&enrichSource=Y292ZXJQYWdlOzIzOTkyNzQ4OTtBUzo5ODg2MTU3NDAwMDY1M0AxNDAwNTgxODQ2ODMz&el=1_x_2&_esc=publicationCoverPdf) for wolf-prey dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Predict wolf and prey population N years beyond initial conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Global assumptions:**\n",
    "  * Isolated habitat with no human interactions\n",
    "  * Restricted habitat area, forcing variable density\n",
    "  * Modeling averages over single year periods (time step = 1 year)\n",
    "  * No animal migration\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "  * Initial wolf population, assume equal male/female?  Ages?  Numbers of each.\n",
    "  * Prey population, within limited species (rabbits, deer, moose, ??).\n",
    "  * Animal reproduction rate: 2->N average per year (2->N is a bit arbitrary).  Does this depend on density?\n",
    "  * Wolf predation rate per species (depends on population density?)\n",
    "  * Habitat size (determines densities)\n",
    "  * Weather adversity index (separately for wolves and prey)\n",
    "  * Disease advertity index (separately for wolves and prey)\n",
    "  * Average animal lifetimes\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Model details/assumptions:**\n",
    "  * Require relationships between preditor and prey densities vs predation rate\n",
    "  * Require relationship between prey density and food competition?\n",
    "      * And also weather adversity?\n",
    "      * Or assume general abundance?\n",
    "  * No dependence of predation rate on age?\n",
    "  * Require relationship between weather adversity and animal death rate\n",
    "  * Require relationship between disease adversity and animal death rate\n",
    "  * Require list of animal attributes & their population distribution\n",
    "  * Require means to pass down traits to offspring (eg, hunting skill or reproduction rate)\n",
    "  * Require model for prey density vs preditor survival rate\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model implementation:**\n",
    "  * Define class for a given animal,\n",
    "      * Decorate with required variables to track animal attributes\n",
    "  * Generate arrays of each species type, populated according to initial conditions\n",
    "  * Iterate one year time steps\n",
    "      * Calculate animal densities\n",
    "      * Determine death events, remove dead animals from arrays (dead animals don't reproduce)\n",
    "      * Determine birth events, adding new animals with new attributes drawn from parents\n",
    "      * Repeat until desired future year"
